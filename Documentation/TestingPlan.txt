a) Refine
   1)create a mesh and a solution (can use TestData.py to set Data.py)
   2)make refinements to those
   3)solve again
   4)compare results with what they should be with the refinement

b) Save and Load (I don't know how to do these separately)
   1)create a mesh and a solution (can use TestData.py to set Data.py)
   2)save them
   3)make changes to the mesh and solution or make a new one
   4)load the first mesh and solution and make sure they match the first
	(Can also compare data in Data.py)

c) Plot
   1) Per Dr. Roberts, "a small driver that generates samples of each plot type"
	("manually look at to see that it looks good")
   2) PlotTests.py creates a plot for each of the six types:
	u1
	u2
	p
	stream
	mesh
	error

d) Program
   1) Not much of a way to test outside of running the program itself

e) Create
   1) Wrapped up necessarily in the program itself as well (run through CamelliaSolver.py)
