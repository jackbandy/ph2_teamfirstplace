Four items of incomparable weight are due for Phase II.

1. Design document:
   a) PlanOutline.txt - You are here :)
   b) outline.jpg


2. Testing plan:
   a) TestingPlan.txt
   b) outline.jpg
   c) Refine
	1)create a mesh and a solution (can use TestData.py to set Data.py)
	2)make refinements to those
	3)solve again
	4)compare results with what they should be with the refinement
   d)Save and Load (I don't know how to do these separately)
	1)create a mesh and a solution (can use TestData.py to set Data.py)
	2)save them
	3)make changes to the mesh and solution or make a new one
	4)load the first mesh and solution and make sure they match the first (Can also compare data in Data.py)


3. Tests:
   a) RunTests.py
   b) TestSuite.py
   *other test documents to come*


4. The program (CamelliaSolver.py):
   a) the parser
   b) ??
